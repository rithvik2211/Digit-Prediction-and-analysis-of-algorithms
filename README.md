# Digit-Prediction-and-analysis-of-algorithms

This repository has 2 parts:
- Analysis on KNN, Decision Tree and Random forest algorithms
- Analysis on SVM algorithm on Linear Kernel, Gaussian Kernel and Polynomial Kernel

**Analysis on KNN, Decision Tree and Random forest algorithms**
In this part I have analysed the accuracy difference that test size makes on 3 algorithms.

**Analysis on SVM algorithm**
In this part I have shown the time taken to train and predict each kernel with different set of parameters.
I have changed parameters such as C _Regularization or Penalty Factor_, gamma and d _degree_ and shown the difference they cause in accuracy.
